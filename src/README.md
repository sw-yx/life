# Header - Top Level Rules

> The topics I have split out below consist of: **Productivity**, **Interpersonal Skills**, **Sales & Psychology**, **Tech Leadership**, **Life & Career Philosophy**, and **Mental Models and Systems Thinking**. It is highly artificial to split these interrelated things, so I extracted the most important, common threads among them to this top level Header section.

- **Micro: Tactical rules to run your life**
    - Smile! It makes you, not just people around you, feel better. ðŸ˜„
    - Learning is more important than earning.
    - Your brain is not a storage device. Have a system to write stuff down (say, on [dev.to](http://dev.to)?) and make it organizable and searchable. 
    - Play to your strengths, hire and work with other people based on their strengths.
    - Remember the power of storytelling. A good story has more power than a good argument.
    - Take pride in artistry in your work, and be generous with the results. People crave the authenticity only you can provide.
    - Mastery is achieved by having a craftsman mindset focusing on rare and valuable skills, making small bets with a remarkable end goal, in the Adjacent Possible. (be [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/980286751657865216))
    - Always be on the lookout for your Purpose in life, and when you find it, align everything to it. As a company, rally employees and customers to your Purpose too. When you find yourself in [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), that's a big hint.
    - **Flow is everything**. Seek out jobs where you can exist in a Flow state. Arrange your environment, calendar, and life around optimizing your time spent in Flow. Your best work will be done here, and the world will reward you for it. Ignore the noise that aims to interrupt your Flow. Kill, destroy, eliminate, extinguish the Unimportant things that pretend to be Urgent (like notifications).
    - Understand what people want. There are many, many, many theories of what people want, but the three big ones are the study of Incentives, of Motivation, and of Fascination.
- **Macro: Big truths to shape your worldview**
    - **[Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)** will get you through tough times and not mislead you during emotional highs and flashes of anger.
    - Technology has profoundly changed so, so many of the rules of our society and economy. Companies and experts used to profit from information asymmetry, and now have to find better ways of delivering value. Effective marketing has switched from constantly interrupting you (eg with commercials and banner ads) to having your permission (eg with blogs and newsletters and referral codes). The Information Age valued left-brain skills, but as these get commoditized and automated, the "Conceptual Age" may now put right-brain aptitudes like Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning on top.
