# Sales & Psychology

- 40% of actions are unconscious habit. Habits stick because you crave reward. Redirect your cravings, don't resist them.
- Habits are formed through a Trigger -> Action -> Reward -> Investment cycle. Spot companies doing this to you, and use it responsibly.
- Establish Keystone Habits, which help you gain a series of small wins and have positive spillover effects for your willpower and habit formation.
- Beware of System 1 Unconscious flaws (Priming, Halo Effect, Confirmation bias) and System 2 Cognitive flaws (Heuristics, Risk Assessment, Memory).
- Your thinking is being influenced by Priming: Fact recall, Word choice, Credit taking, etc. When making critical decisions, try to take them out of the given context.
- Things go viral if they have Social Currency (makes people look good), Triggers (top of mind), Emotional value, Publicity, Practical Value, or a entertaining/educational Story.
- Ideas are sticky when presented as: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete (with examples or imagery), Credible (backed up with Experts, Stats, or with your audience), Emotional, and having a Story.
- There are 6 weapons of Influence: Reciprocation, Commitment & Consistency, Social Proof, Liking, Authority, and Scarcity.
- There are 4 ways people respond to Outer and Inner expectations. Upholders value self-reliance; just tell them what you need. Questioners value purpose; justify what you want to them. Obligers value teamwork; hold them accountable. Rebels value freedom; let them decide what to do.
- There are 7 triggers of Fascination: Lust (triggering anticipation of pleasure), Mystique (filling knowledge gaps), Alarm (tending to relevant threats), Prestige (going for social status), Power (desire for control), Vice (forbidden things), Trust (familiar things).
- We justify our actions, not vice versa.
- When shit happens, you can reconstruct your reality in a positive way.
- Snap judgments are good at filtering signal from noise and when primed with intelligence and experience. They are bad when rationalizing gut feel, associating competence with looks, under stress, and when unconscious bias is present.
- People have 3 levels of motivation: Basic needs, Extrinsic (eg money, force), Intrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is strongest and is driven by the Flow state, pursuit of meaning, self determination, challenging tasks, and having a voice in decisions. 
- You can also phrase this as the study of incentives: economic, social, and moral. Beware unintended consequences applying incentives out of context, or replacing a big, unquantifiable incentive (eg moral) with a smaller but more measurable one (eg economic).
- Flow is enjoyment of novelty and growth, skillful, immersive, involves challenge and intrinsic reward. Gamify work.
- Do Permission marketing instead of interruption marketing: Appeal to self-interest, focus your efforts on a qualified audience. Your goal is building a relationship, not making a sale. Teach the benefits of your product, and earn trust. This builds long term loyalty and virality.
