# Tech Leadership

- Hire based on strength, not absence of weakness. Hire only when necessary. Build flexible teams. Always ask if you have the right people in the right place. Fire fast and fair.
- Having the right People is more important than the right Ideas and Processes.
- Know when you need to focus on strategy vs execution, being a peacetime vs wartime CEO.
- Find and Articulate a simple vision. Make sure this message is delivered, and role model it. Communicate it with a KPI or North Star.
- Motivate people. People work harder when needed and united by a goal. Evaluate performance by team results. Give them feedback and the support they need. Encourage healthy competition.
- Assess people's Task Relevant Maturity. If they are very experienced at the task, give them room. If they aren't be more hands on. Reevaluate as time passes. Very similar to parenting.
- Decisionmaking: Is this decision worth making? Define who is responsible for the decision, learn from the past, and solicit alternative views.
- Monitor, pair, and trend indicators to run the business and understand the levers. Prioritize goals and identify obstacles. Proactively detect problems.
- Avoid Secrecy. Promote open communications/radical truth in relationships and evaluations; use flowcharts and metrics to clarify how things work.
- Try new things and expect to Fail. Fail early and plan iterations. Spend "wasteful" R&D in order to be first to market. Allow personal project days.
- Build momentum.
- Technology is JUST an accelerator. It won't fix what you don't have.
- Promote a culture of discipline.
- Put thought into designing the workplace.
- Level 5 leaders are Excellent managers, Modest, Ambitious, do succession planning, Confront facts, and engage in Socratic Debate.
- How to Cross the Chasm from Visionaries to Pragmatists: Have a Whole Product, establish a Beach-head, make a Powerful Claim, lock down your Distribution Channels, and price like a Market Leader.
- Ask 7 Questions: Is this 10x better? Is this the right time? Can I get a large market share? Do I have the right people? Can I reach the right customers? Can this survive competition? Is this non-consensus?
- B2B > B2C.
- Human-centered Design: Helps users learn to use the product; avoids dangerous errors, and brings users and tech closer together. 
- The power of Word of Mouth means you have to be remarkable or die. Taking risk is SAFER than avoiding risk. Invent with marketing in mind.
- Launch earlier, stand for something, and make it inimitable. Launch early, repeatedly, and authentically.
- Encouraging Focused work is better than long hours.
- Series of quick decisions is better than overplanning.
- Help people manage themselves.
- Start from the problem, not the solution.
- Identify the market's central Pivot; Isolate and create demand around it; Innovate and anticipate second-order effects; Test hypotheses; learn from others' past.
- How to form a Tribe, create a Movement around your cause: Start by giving generously and authentically, connect to an existing yearning in a new way, tell a story of the future, create channels for horizontal and vertical connection, and give them something to DO.
