# Mental Models and Systems Thinking

- Antifragile systems benefit from volatility, depend on fragile constituents, and overcompensate to stressors.
- Understand stocks vs flows, Positive vs Negative feedback, System resilience, Self organizing systems, and Hierarchical/Fractal systems.
- Mistakes in systems: Managing by only looking at outcomes, doing linear projection and false isolation, having slow/no feedback.
- Look at the 12 Leverage Points in a system: Parameters < Buffer size < Structure < Delay < -ve feedback < +ve feedback < Info flow < Rules < Self Organization < Goals < Mindset < Transcendence.
- Know the difference between scalable info (where you can draw useful conclusions at different scales) and unscalable info.
- Image matters more in situations where people (bankers, politicians etc) have no skin in the game, while Competence matters more where SITG is fully tied in (doctors, entrepreneurs)
