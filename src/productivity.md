# Productivity

- Your brain is not a storage device. Put ideas and tasks in a central source of truth, for example a Checklist or a Trello board. Modern human knowledge is too huge to store, organize, and apply all within our brains.
- Discard things that have served their purpose. Say No more often.
- Don't multitask. Multitasking is not Productivity.
- Your willpower is limited.
- Be proactive, take control. 
- Begin with the end in mind; have a Mission, Vision, and specific Goals.
- Put first things first. Urgent != Important; do Urgent & Important things first, then Important Non-urgent things. Avoid Urgent Unimportant things.
- Sharpen the Saw and Recharge. Make sure to balance personal with professional life.
- Make room and Define your working space. Define your work time vs free time. Define your online time vs offline time. Boundaries help you do deep work.
- Do premortems envisioning how your project might fail. Talk to your future self, and use the "uh-oh" effect to spur you to a strong finish.
- Use short Checklists to prevent avoidable mistakes, and schedule communication for teams.
