# Life & Career Philosophy

- Life is too short for complaining or lounging.
- When shit happens, you can reconstruct your reality in a positive way.
- The Days are Long but the Years are Short. The little things you do every day matter more than the big things you try to do once in a while.
- Being right is an illusion: choose values you can control, learn from failure, commit to things and narrow your options.
- Identify and write down your core Principles: fundamental truths to keep you on goal.
- Build up to big goals with low level goals. Balance deliberate vs emergent strategy.
- Choose interesting work.
- Avoid our hidden bias to blame and reward Talent. Effort and Grit is more valuable than Talent; you can go very very far with Deliberate and Intelligent Practice.
- Be in permanent beta and prioritize learning. Learning is more important than Money. Constant learning.
- Know yourself. Know your competitive advantage.
- Pursue breakout opportunities doggedly.
- There are 2 levels of Networking you should pursue: Deep Professional Alliances, and broad, weak acquaintances. Both can be valuable. Relationships need constant work but have a long term payoff.
- Satisfaction = Motivation + Discipline
- Apprentice under a mentor, then outgrow.
- To reach Mastery: Challenge what you have learned. Broaden your mind. Practice skills until they are automatic. Focus on the bigger picture.
- The dominant Medium of our era defines our ideas of truth.
- New tech is always underestimated as extending existing tech.
- Play to your strengths; look for strength in others; deal with coworker frustration by involving their strengths.
- Death is a part of life; live life with meaning while facing death.
- A Growth mindset seeks Development, views Failures as Opportunities, and relish Difficulties. Changing your mindset: Changing role models, reaching out for support, talking about mistakes.
- Play Infinite Games: see a series of moments, endless possibilities, no clear winners, treat it as play, and liberated from the past.
- Grab attention, define a niche, and command loyalty.
- Be fascinated by what you do, stay in flow.
- Eat to Live: >2lbs of greens a day, get 90% of your calories from plants.
- The Resistance opposes all our creative endeavors. Treat your dream like a job and work at it.
- Invoke muses
- Fight hierarchy
- Own a territory.
- Choosing careers: Making a difference, freedom, flow.
- Overcome fear of career change
- Avoid the hedonic treadmill
- Take risks, have clear preferences, build a business. Avoid laziness and arrogance.
- The Information age has become the Conceptual Age: Emphasis on left-brain has given way to "right directed thinking", where Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning have gained more importance today.
- Be a Linchpin. Linchpins are indispensable artists who find their own way instead of taking instruction, who put emotional labor into their work and gain a reputation for it, who choose to fight fear and discomfort by repeat exposure instead of retreat.
- We mistake luck for skill (the narrative fallacy) and forget that life is non-linear and path-dependent. Going the last mile often has asymmetric payoff, and also pay attention to overconfidence in risks you don't fully know (Ludic fallacy).
- Much of Media is noise. Don't listen to noise.
- "Do what you love" is wrong. Learn to love what you do through achieving Mastery, Autonomy, and deep Relationships.
- Mastery is achieved by having a craftsman mindset focusing on rare and valuable skills, making small bets with a remarkable end goal, in the Adjacent Possible.
